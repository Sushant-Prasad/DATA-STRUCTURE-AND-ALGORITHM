/**
 * Title: Minimum Cost to Connect Ropes/ connect N ropes
 *
 * Problem:
 * Given N ropes with different lengths, we need to connect them into a single rope.
 * The cost of connecting two ropes is equal to the sum of their lengths.
 * We must find the minimum total cost to connect all ropes.
 *
 * Approach (Greedy + Min-Heap):
 * - Always connect the two smallest ropes first (this ensures minimal cost at each step).
 * - Insert all rope lengths into a Min-Heap (PriorityQueue).
 * - Repeatedly remove the two smallest ropes, add their cost to total, 
 *   and insert the new combined rope back into the heap.
 * - Continue until only one rope remains.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Building heap: O(n)
 * - Each remove/insert operation: O(log n)
 * - Done (n-1) times â‡’ O(n log n)
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(n) for storing the heap
